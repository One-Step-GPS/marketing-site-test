    It has been said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. But
    what does that really mean and how does it work with your business, your
    fleet? We’d like to show you how we can help you save money on vehicle
    service and maintenance with GPS tracking. You can do a lot more than just
    know where your vehicle is when you have real-time tracking.
  </p>

  <h2>How Does GPS Tracking Work?</h2>

  <p>
    So how does it work? There are two parts to any GPS tracking solution, the
    tracker itself, which is a hardware unit easily installed in your vehicle,
    and the tracking software that gets the data from the unit and shows it to
    you. You can use a computer, tablet or smartphone, whatever. How you access
    the data really has to do with how you need it. Every tier of our One Step
    GPS tracking subscriptions comes standard with vehicle maintenance tracking.
    You can set up reminders for different maintenance activities based on
    number of days, number of miles, number of engine hours, it’s up to you.
  </p>

  <h2>How To Install A GPS Tracker In A Car</h2>

  <p>
    The tracking device can plug into your odb port or install under your dash.
    It’s easy and takes minutes at most and you’re all set for next level
    service alerts. Most modern vehicles will tell you when they need servicing.
    Whether it’s a light on the dash console, or otherwise, the vehicle has
    diagnostic electronics to let someone know if something needs to be fixed,
    or when you need an oil change. That’s great, but next level is customizing
    everything you want to know. Wouldn’t it be convenient to get text and email
    alerts when your vehicle needed to be serviced. Better yet, what if you
    could track mileage and automatically set up servicing notifications. It’s
    that easy to do.
  </p>

  <p>
    Just imagine being able to manage many, many vehicles. Your drivers may not
    think to let you know when a vehicle needs maintenance. They might assume
    you know when you don’t. Besides, people care for things differently when
    they don’t own them. The way someone else took care of their personal
    vehicle might even amaze you. So why leave these things to chance when you
    can easily and accurately track your vehicle service reminders. It could
    cost you a great deal in unnecessary expenses and depreciation.
  </p>

  <h2>Vehicle GPS Service Alerts</h2>

  <p>
    Given the solutions available with GPS tracking, you can see a whole new
    system for maintenance and repair is possible. You have the information to
    be able to schedule and get routine actions done without disrupting your
    operation. You can easily predict when a vehicle will need service and make
    sure other vehicles and drivers can pick up the slack. That is what modern
    fleet management is all about.
  </p>

  <p>
    Driver error is going to cost you. Excessive braking or misuse of an engine
    through abrupt acceleration are going to cut down the life of your vehicle
    and rack up repairs. A driver who isn't paying attention, or who is
    inexperienced, can easily damage a vehicle. Real-time tracking can alert you
    when your vehicle is being driven badly. It can log where a vehicle has been
    and how it was driven, useful for establishing the facts of damage or
    negligence. It means you can show your driver what they were doing and help
    them improve their driving habits. Just knowing that the vehicle is being
    tracked is enough to encourage some drivers to improve their handling of a
    vehicle.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok, so GPS tracking will help you streamline service scheduling, service
    reminders and service history. You can even add parts and vendors, their
    contact details, and keep a complete history of the vehicle. You are going
    to get control over the care of the vehicle and ultimately it’s resale
    value.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fuel efficiency, tracked, becomes a very useful tool in determining, in
    advance, of impending repairs because when that efficiency changes then
    obviously something is going on with that vehicle. Just seeing that
    something has changed with the fuel efficiency is a flag you can get alerted
    to and get that vehicle inspected and serviced right away. Long distance
    drivers need this information for fuel taxes too, you get the idea?
  </p>
