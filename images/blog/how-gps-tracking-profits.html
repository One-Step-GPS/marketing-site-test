    Perhaps you have considered investing in GPS tracking for your company.
    You’ve considered the benefits and it’s looking like something worth doing.
    You want to get your team on board. So let’s help you out and go over what
    we can do to help your team pull together, save money and increase profits.
  </p>

  <h2>Fleet Tracking Solutions</h2>

  <p>
    So first off, can you save money for the company? Well, what costs you money
    with your fleet? Fuel, maintenance and service costs? Add to that driver
    error – bad driving habits and insurance busting accidents. All of these
    things can add significant expense to your bottom line. But is there really
    no way to control them? For many companies wasted money will become budgeted
    expenses, how crazy is that?
  </p>
  <p>
    Arguably fuel is a no brainer expense, you have to have fuel to run your
    vehicles. True, but could you spend less on fuel and have more money for
    something else? Absolutely, and here’s an example of how. With easy
    installation you get GPS tracking up and running in a vehicle. With One Step
    GPS we get you set up with unreal data access. Real-time tracking shows how
    fast the vehicle is going and how your driver is accelerating and
    decelerating. In other words you can know where a driver is putting
    excessive strain on the engine, leading to decreased fuel economy and brake
    and engine repairs on the horizon. You can set alerts for unsafe events,
    straight to your phone.
  </p>
  <p>
    This kind of driver error is easy to correct. In fact many drivers will
    automatically improve their habits when they know that you can see how they
    drive. A driver might not even realize how much money could be saved just by
    changing how they accelerate and brake, and when they do, they know they are
    helping the company waste less, which is going to come back to them too.
    Same for truckers. Fatigue puts a driver at risk and with GPS tracking you
    can be sure your drivers are getting rest. The technology gets everyone
    involved so your driver doesn’t push themself past their optimum condition
    and knows you’re on their side.
  </p>

  <h2>Save Money On Fleet Maintenance</h2>

  <p>
    How about cutting costs with servicing and maintenance? GPS tracking can
    help you with vehicle service reminders in many ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    Set up maintenance based on mileage. Set an alert by miles driven, engine
    hours or days. You get the maintenance done when it’s needed, not too early
    and certainly not when it’s too late. Consistently keeping a vehicle in good
    running order is going to save you money. Sure the driver can keep an eye on
    it – but why not monitor and manage the whole fleet with GPS tracking? Track
    parts, vendors, service histories. This is a very very scalable solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    But why stop with just that. We can help you monitor a deeper level of data
    in terms of the condition of the engine and on-board diagnostics, so you
    have a real-time picture of the state of your vehicle and the ability to
    detect and handle problems proactively. That’s right – you can see when
    vital repairs are needed by alerts and get them fixed fast. Please ask our
    One Step GPS representative about everything you can do, they will help you
    find the solution you need.

  <p>
    So what are we looking at here? It’s a new era for fleet management. Just as
    your company knows where everyone is at and what they are doing at the
    office, so now the same can be true for your drivers and fleet. You’re going
    to save money on your vehicles, fuel and insurance. A company can take pride
    in saving on unnecessary expenses and being more profitable, more
    successful.
