  <p>
    One of the biggest reasons to invest in GPS tracking today is the insight
    you gain. We want to cover how you can use that insight to save money, save
    on insurance and prolong the life of your fleet. We know running a fleet
    costs real money. You have the investment in the truck, van or car, you have
    fuel costs, maintenance as well the insurance to guard against accidents and
    vandalism. Given that a commercial vehicle has a vital purpose for you,
    whether it’s freight, delivery or service the one thing for sure is that it
    is going to get driven a whole lot and unlike a personal vehicle it’s likely
    that that will mean putting in a lot of miles. But can you justify vehicle
    tracking device cost?
  </p>

  <p>
    With GPS tracking linked to your smartphone, tablet or computer you can see
    in real-time where your vehicle is at all times. It also means you can track
    mileage. This feature is especially important and convenient for
    long-distance drivers, but being able to track mileage has many other
    benefits. Add to this the potential for text and email alerts and you have
    multiple ways to be alerted to the status of your vehicles at all times, or
    as fits your needs.
  </p>

  <h2>Features of a GPS tracking system</h2>

  <p>
    Our GPS tracking software allows you to see where your vehicle is at all
    times - on your phone, tablet or computer. When you add in text and email
    alerts, or even push notifications in your app, you can set up alerts for
    just about any circumstance you can imagine. Want to know if one of your
    employees stops at your favorite sandwich shop? You can be alerted via text,
    so you can call him and make sure he brings something back to the office for
    you! (Or any number of more productive uses of the alerting functionality.)
    Want to know every time one of your employees brakes harshly, takes a hard
    turn, sits idling for over ‘x’ amount of minutes, sits idling over ‘x’
    amount of minutes within a certain geographic location? There's almost no
    limit to the customization you can achieve with alerts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aggressive acceleration and braking are going to wear out your vehicle
    faster, and use more gas. That’s going to cost you more. So imagine being
    easily able to see how your drivers are doing. You can even show them what
    you’re seeing and advise them on better driving habits as needed. Your GPS
    tracking data takes any opinion about a drivers habits out of the mix – you
    just have exact and precise data and that means you can work with your
    drivers to prolong the life of the vehicles they drive, save gas and cut
    down costs.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s also a powerful tool where it comes to traffic events – accidents,
    reckless driving etc., You can easily establish the facts of a traffic
    incident and establish responsibility. This can save you serious money on
    insurance, fend off false claims and keep your premiums down. Insurance
    costs need not be out of control when you have GPS tracking.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next benefit of tracking mileage is that you can schedule maintenance
    very precisely. Depending on the configuration this can be automatically set
    up, saving you more money on vehicles by keeping them to scheduled
    maintenance cycles, warranties – you get the idea. Please contact one of our
    associates at One Step GPS to find out about how deeply you can integrate
    GPS tracking, they can fill you in on all the options available.
  </p>

  <p>
    With GPS tracking you can easily spot and curtail unauthorized vehicle use.
    Without a tracker you really don’t know where your vehicle has been and
    frankly that means a less than honest employee can take advantage. You would
    not want your vehicle being used for your employees ‘moonlight’ activities.
    Perhaps you don’t mind a little bit of personal use , but enough is enough,
    right?
  </p>

  <p>
    If your vehicle carries tools or valuable equipment knowing where it is at
    all times is vital as the first deterrent to theft is keeping it away from
    would be thieves. Keeping that vehicle away from locations where it might be
    vandalized or robbed is vital. And when your employees know that the
    location of their vehicle is being tracked in real-time they are going to
    want to help you, and your tracking data can be easily shared with law
    enforcement should the need arise.
  </p>

  <p>
    It goes without saying that the security of your fleet has everything to do
    with keeping your costs down and real peace of mind.
  </p>
