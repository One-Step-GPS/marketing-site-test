    So you are looking for the right company to get you set up with tracking for
    your vehicles. You want a low monthly payment, easy installation and no
    contract. You would like to save money, of course. But now you have a bunch
    of names from your Google Search and all you have to go on are the claims
    those car tracking companies made on those sites.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s definitely a good start, and unless you got a great referral from a
    friend this may be the only info you have. So now you or your employee is
    going through all these websites, trying to figure out which one might meet
    your needs. The problem is that though websites are very accessible and
    online businesses will often offer the most competitive rates, helping you
    save money, how do you really know who you are dealing with?
  </p>

  <h2>GPS tracking companies</h2>

  <p>
    With so many businesses taking on GPS tracking as part of their normal
    operations today it would be easy to assume that all provider companies are
    pretty much the same. They are not. It is important to think about the
    business model of the company you are looking at hiring. Are they operating
    for sales now or your business for years to come? How do you tell the
    difference?
  </p>

  <p>
    Sure, most everyone offers real-time tracking, text and email alerts and
    options for vehicle service reminders, tracking mileage and ELD integration.
    But do they actually know and understand the services they are selling?
    Yeah, that sales guy says he does, but how do you know? Is there a way to
    find out which companies are working to get customers who will
    <i>stay</i> customers for years to come?
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s right, the one component that makes online business sometimes very
    frustrating is Customer Service. How many online services have you used that
    were great, really convenient and competitively priced UNTIL you had to
    reach someone for customer service. Next thing you’re talking to someone who
    is being paid minimum wage to do that job, or who is in a call center in
    another country and whose stock line is to apologize for some problem, but
    who is clearly unable to really help you. Customer Service should never be
    an afterthought for a successful company, so what does that say about a
    company that has theirs setup in such an inconvenient way?
  </p>

  <p>
    Makes sense? Why gamble on a company like that? Sure, you could get lucky
    and never have any issues. But if your criteria for a GPS tracking company
    is based on getting low-cost, no contract, but I want all the bells and
    whistles, then that customer service component is going to save you a lot of
    money when you need it. Because the truth is there are plenty of potential
    providers – but are they going to be your GPS go-to solution.
  </p>

  <h2>GPS Tracking Customer Service</h2>

  <p>
    You are going to win with a company that is founded on customer service,
    because if that service is knowledgeable, with an honest desire to help you,
    then you know you are working with a company that genuinely wants to help
    and keep you as a customer for years to come. Even if you are looking at a
    no contract plan for short term use. At the very least you would want the
    same customer service representative to walk you through from initial
    consultation to final sale and you’d know you had a solid reliable company
    to back you up at any point in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    For us at One Step GPS, the value of customer service is the core component
    of our success. It’s made us an industry leader. Although it’s true that
    motivated sales representatives can crush sell anything to anyone, they
    won’t be able to keep doing that forever if they don’t service customers
    very well from initial contact, through sales and follow up service. A
    customer is going to look elsewhere. Besides which, why would you have to
    sell a really good service? You wouldn’t, you’d just need to be able to
    demonstrate that your company had what the customer needed, that they could
    get it easily, and that it was available for a competitive price.
