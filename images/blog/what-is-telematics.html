  <p>
    We might be the only company of our kind that goes to the trouble of making
    sure you understand everything about GPS tracking products. We even provide
    a glossary of all the terms related to our industry. Take telematics:
    Telematics is the branch of information technology that deals with the
    long-distance transmission of computerized information. The term was coined
    from "telos" meaning long distance and "informatics" - itself a combination
    of information and automatic/automated.
  </p>
  <p>
    So telematics addresses the technology of sending and receiving computerized
    information over long distances, and a global positioning system, or GPS, is
    a telematics device. So what is that device doing? It’s communicating with
    the GPS System of satellites.
  </p>

  <h2>GPS Telematics</h2>

  <p>
    The technology was originally developed by the US Military and became usable
    to the broad public in 2000. The GPS system actually refers to a network of
    satellites orbiting the planet. As of 2019 there are 31 satellites in the
    GPS constellation, with 27 in use at any one time. At any time nine
    satellites are visible from any point on the planet. The system needs a
    minimum of four satellites to get an accurate fix on location, providing
    there is a clear line of sight. By 2018 this technology was so accurate it
    could pinpoint location to an accuracy of about 12 inches.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what is your tracker doing? At any time it is acting as a receiver for
    data from these satellites so as to get an exact location, in real time.
    Tracking, combined with telematics, is getting the location data to you at
    any remote location, via your computer, tablet or phone. So you can see
    where your tracked vehicle is in real-time. The telematics involved take
    that raw location data and turn it into something useful. A great example
    would the real-time display of where your are when navigating with Google
    Maps.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to business applications, telematics are nothing short of
    incredible. Want to know how long a driver has been at particular location,
    if his engine is idling or off? Want to be alerted any time a driver breaks
    the speed limit, and be able to adjust that parameter to whatever the speed
    limit is where that driver is a present? You get the idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    Telematics can show you the condition of your fleet, alerting you to when
    maintenance and servicing are needed. Modern vehicles already have
    sophisticated onboard computers that log everything like oil and tire
    pressure, engine condition and malfunction etc., Combine this with real time
    tracking, weather data, fuel economy and you can build an extremely detailed
    picture of individual driving habits, good and bad or use the same
    information for insurance, or managing maintenance of your whole fleet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Geofencing is widely used in GPS tracking application. It allows a
    predefined virtual perimeter to be set up, just like a real-world geographic
    fence. It lets software trigger an action when the GPS tracker enters or
    leave the virtual fence. For example you can be alerted whenever a vehicle
    enters or leaves one of your geofences. This useful for knowing all the
    vehicles got back to business headquarters or could alert you to unexpected
    or unauthorized movement. Alerts can be sent via text, email or whatever way
    works for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the case of tracking trailers or containers, combined with a self-powered
    GPS tracker, geofencing could alert you right away if one of those trailers
    moved. These trackers are kept active by a solar cell charging built in
    batteries, meaning they can be left unattended for months or longer in all
    types of climates – wet, cold or arid.
