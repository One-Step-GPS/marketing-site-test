            "text": "Hardwired trackers are integrated directly into the vehicle's electrical system, a process that requires a professional mechanic or someone with low-voltage experience. This permanent installation offers enhanced security as the unit is discreetly concealed, making it difficult to locate and tamper with. Plug-in GPS trackers are designed for easy installation and removal, connecting directly to the vehicle’s OBD-II port without needing professional installation. While this design ensures flexibility and convenience, it also requires additional measures to conceal the unit, protecting it from tampering or theft. Unlike hardwired units, plug-in trackers provide detailed insights into engine performance and other diagnostic data due to their direct connection to the vehicle’s diagnostics port. The choice between hardwired and plug-in GPS fleet trackers hinges on the balance between security and convenience. Hardwired units are suited for those seeking a more permanent and secure solution, while plug-in units cater to users who value flexibility, ease of installation, and detailed vehicle diagnostics."

You can also send the information to as many people/users as needed to ensure your trackers will always be online. Additionally, the tracker has a 10-hour backup battery so if the tracker is still in the vehicle when disconnected you can still track and recover the vehicle with ease. This feature also works if someone disconnects the battery and tows the vehicle."

                  By tracking driver identification, you can monitor driver
                  behavior, such as speeding, harsh braking, and acceleration,
                  and ensure that they are adhering to company policies and

                  What's the difference between hardwired trackers and plug-in
                  trackers?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hardwired trackers are integrated directly into the vehicle's
                  electrical system, a process that requires a professional
                  mechanic or someone with low-voltage experience. This
                  permanent installation offers enhanced security as the unit is
                  discreetly concealed, making it difficult to locate and tamper
                  with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Plug-in GPS trackers are designed for easy installation and
                  removal, connecting directly to the vehicle’s OBD-II port
                  without needing professional installation. While this design
                  ensures flexibility and convenience, it also requires
                  additional measures to conceal the unit, protecting it from
                  tampering or theft. Unlike hardwired units, plug-in trackers
                  provide detailed insights into engine performance and other
                  diagnostic data due to their direct connection to the
                  vehicle’s diagnostics port.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The choice between hardwired and plug-in GPS fleet trackers
                  hinges on the balance between security and convenience.
                  Hardwired units are suited for those seeking a more permanent
                  and secure solution, while plug-in units cater to users who
                  value flexibility, ease of installation, and detailed vehicle
                  diagnostics.

                  What happens if someone disconnects the hardwired GPS unit?
                </p>
                <p>
                  To put it simply, you will know as soon as someone removes the
                  device.
                </p>
                <p>We offer many different ways to send alerts:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Email</li>
                  <li>Text messages</li>

                  <li>Reports</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  You can also send the information to as many people/users as
                  needed to ensure your trackers will always be online.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, the tracker has a 10-hour backup battery so if
                  the tracker is still in the vehicle when disconnected you can
                  still track and recover the vehicle with ease. This feature
                  also works if someone disconnects the battery and tows the
                  vehicle."

                  Depending on the vehicle and familiarity, it takes anywhere
                  from 15 minutes to an hour. To install the hardwired unit you
                  need to only connect three wires. Red gets connected to a wire
                  with constant power, Black gets connected to a ground, and
                  White gets connected to a wire that only gets power when the
                  vehicle is turned on.

                  Yes! The hardwired GPS tracker provides real-time reports on

                <p>
                  Installing a GPS tracker in your vehicle could potentially
                  void the warranty, as is the case with many other aftermarket
                  devices. Be sure to check your vehicle’s warranty to
                  understand your rights, and ensure that your GPS device is
                  properly installed in order to reduce the likelihood of
                  voiding the warranty.

                <p>
                  The major benefit of a hardwired GPS tracker is that it's more
                  discreet, more difficult to find and more difficult to remove
                  or tamper with. While the other types can be hidden, if theft
                  or tampering is a primary concern for you consider using a
                  hardwired GPS tracker instead of a plug-in since it can be
                  hidden virtually anywhere three feet of your electrical
                  connection which makes it a much harder target to find.

                    Hardwired trackers are integrated directly into the
                    vehicle's electrical system, a process that requires a
                    professional mechanic or someone with low-voltage
                    experience. This permanent installation offers enhanced
                    security as the unit is discreetly concealed, making it
                    difficult to locate and tamper with.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Plug-in GPS trackers are designed for easy installation and
                    removal, connecting directly to the vehicle’s OBD-II port
                    without needing professional installation. While this design
                    ensures flexibility and convenience, it also requires
                    additional measures to conceal the unit, protecting it from
                    tampering or theft. Unlike hardwired units, plug-in trackers
                    provide detailed insights into engine performance and other
                    diagnostic data due to their direct connection to the
                    vehicle’s diagnostics port.

                    The choice between hardwired and plug-in GPS fleet trackers
                    hinges on the balance between security and convenience.
                    Hardwired units are suited for those seeking a more
                    permanent and secure solution, while plug-in units cater to
                    users who value flexibility, ease of installation, and
                    detailed vehicle diagnostics.

                  <p>
                    Additionally, the tracker has a 10-hour backup battery so if
                    the tracker is still in the vehicle when disconnected you
                    can still track and recover the vehicle with ease. This

                    from 15 minutes to an hour. To install the hardwired unit
                    you need to only connect three wires. Red gets connected to
                    a wire with constant power, Black gets connected to a

                    In simple terms this means that, in good weather conditions,
                    your GPS will report vehicles within several feet of their
                    actual physical location. Our GPS fleet trackers deliver
                    superior accuracy so you can make confident decisions based
                    on the data you’re receiving.

                  <p>
                    With GPS tracking updates as often as every 2-30 seconds,

                    Installing a GPS tracker in your vehicle could potentially
                    void the warranty, as is the case with many other
                    aftermarket devices. Be sure to check your vehicle’s
                    warranty to understand your rights, and ensure that your GPS
                    device is properly installed in order to reduce the
                    likelihood of voiding the warranty.

                    The major benefit of a hardwired GPS tracker is that it's
                    more discreet, more difficult to find and more difficult to
                    remove or tamper with. While the other types can be hidden,
                    if theft or tampering is a primary concern for you consider
                    using a hardwired GPS tracker instead of a plug-in since it
                    can be hidden virtually anywhere three feet of your
                    electrical connection which makes it a much harder target to
                    find.

                    We recommend installing the GPS tracker under the dash, this
                    is the most convenient and effective placement of the unit.
