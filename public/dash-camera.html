              The LTE connected Dash Camera provides real-time GPS tracking and
              dual camera video capture capabilities in a simple to use and easy
              to install package. It also serves as a heads-up display for your
              drivers, providing current and posted speed information, fuel
              level and other important information at a glance, allowing
              drivers to keep their eyes on the road. I was able to return the
              vehicle to the office within three hours of its reported missing.
              I was able to offer the police officer a full report on where the
              vehicle went the entire time it was gone, along with the video
              footage from our cameras that caught the picture of the guy that
              took it for the joy ride.

                  Store up to 60 hours of driving time video at the highest
                  resolution while the vehicle is engine on. This can be
                  extended to 90 or 115 hours by reducing video quality. Once
                  the card is full, it will automatically overwrite the oldest
                  5-minute file to make room for the next recording.<br /><br />
                  Contact us if you'd like to use a 512GB micro SD to double

                  in a light/medium-duty vehicle with a 16-pin OBDII port.<br /><br />

                  An 8ft cable connecting our GPS camera to the vehicleâ€™s OBD
                  port is included. Adapter cables are required for J1939
                  vehicles or 2-wire installation.<br /><br />

                  Our GPS camera also includes a universal mount that can be
                  used to install the device on the vehicleâ€™s windshield or
                  dashboard.<br /><br />

                  One Step's GPS camera can be installed on the dashboard or
                  windshield based on your preference. If installed in the
                  driverâ€™s field of view, it can serve as a heads-up display,
                  providing real-time information, including speed, fuel level,
                  and direction of travel.<br /><br />

                  The adhesive at the base of the universal mount will not leave
                  any residue when removed. Two additional adhesives are
                  provided to relocate the device.

                  Our GPS camera always monitors your vehicleâ€™s battery and will

                  voltage falls below 11.9VDC for more than 5 minutes. This

                <div class="paragraph-text">
                  Yes! Our GPS camera can provide your drivers with audible and
                  visual notifications for speeding and cellphone usage events
                  when they are detected, serving to assist the driver in
                  complying with rules of the road and company policies. Many of
                  the companies we work with implement safety training sessions
                  where any risky driving footage is reviewed with drivers as
                  continuing safety training.

                  How can I address concerns from drivers who are uncomfortable
                  with the idea of being recorded?
                </summary>

                <div class="paragraph-text">
                  First of all, try to look from the perspective of the driver.
                  Having a camera monitoring their performance may feel foreign
                  or uncomfortable, but reassuring them that it is a tool to
                  protect and support them as much as the company often helps
                  resolve these situations.<br /><br />

                  Commercial vehicles are considered an extension of the
                  workplace. Therefore, capturing video of the vehicle cabin is
                  typically permissible in the same way you may do in your
                  office or warehouse.<br /><br />

                  Here are some tips to help the process go as smoothly as
                  possible:<br /><br />

                  <ol class="m-0">
                    <li>
                      Be transparent and honest about what data is collected,
                      why, and how it will benefit not only the company but the
                      driver (Dashcams can be effective in exonerating drivers
                      who did not cause the accident)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Establish clear policies for what you expect from drivers
                      so they're aware of what you expect from them
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Provide training and instruction on how your drivers can
                      access their records and information, empower them to take
                      even more control of their work
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Reward good performance and use poor performance as an
                      opportunity for improvement rather than punishment When
                      implemented intelligently, fleet tracking will improve
                      your driver retention and loyalty
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  There have been rare occasions where drivers have become upset
                  or even quit when monitoring is implemented, and that's great.
                  Anyone afraid to be tracked is hiding something that could be
                  far more damaging to your company than a temporary opening in
                  your line-up.<br /><br />

                  Many of our customers report successes like this:<br /><br />
                  "We have been using One Step GPS for over 2 years and we are
                  very happy with their service and product. They have helped us

                        J1939 vehicles or 2-wire installation.<br /><br />

                        Our GPS camera also includes a universal mount that can
                        be used to install the device on the vehicleâ€™s
                        windshield or dashboard.

                        uncomfortable with the idea of being recorded?
                      </div>
                      <div class="paragraph-text">
                        First of all, try to look from the perspective of the
                        driver. Having a camera monitoring their performance may
                        feel foreign or uncomfortable, but reassuring them that
                        it is a tool to protect and support them as much as the
                        company often helps resolve these situations.<br /><br />

                        Commercial vehicles are considered an extension of the
                        workplace. Therefore, capturing video of the vehicle
                        cabin is typically permissible in the same way you may
                        do in your office or warehouse.<br /><br />

                        Here are some tips to help the process go as smoothly as
                        possible:<br /><br />

                        <ol class="m-0">
                          <li>
                            Be transparent and honest about what data is
                            collected, why, and how it will benefit not only the
                            company but the driver (Dashcams can be effective in
                            exonerating drivers who did not cause the accident)
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Establish clear policies for what you expect from
                            drivers so they're aware of what you expect from
                            them
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Provide training and instruction on how your drivers
                            can access their records and information, empower
                            them to take even more control of their work
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Reward good performance and use poor performance as
                            an opportunity for improvement rather than
                            punishment When implemented intelligently, fleet
                            tracking will improve your driver retention and
                            loyalty
                          </li>
                        </ol>

                        There have been rare occasions where drivers have become
                        upset or even quit when monitoring is implemented, and
                        that's great. Anyone afraid to be tracked is hiding
                        something that could be far more damaging to your
                        company than a temporary opening in your line-up.<br /><br />

                        The ease and security of an LTE-connected OSG Camera are

                        visibility into your fleet operations, allowing you to
                        verify the safety and security of the vehicle and its

                        in real-time or historically with the benefit of
                        real-time video can improve safety, peace of mind, and
                        operational efficiencies in ways that a traditional dash

              <p>
                The LTE-connected Dash Camera provides real-time GPS tracking
                and dual camera video capture capabilities in a simple-to-use,
                easy-to-install package.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also serves as a heads-up display for your drivers, providing
                current and posted speed information, fuel level, and other
                important information at a glance, allowing drivers to keep
                their eyes and attention on the road.
              </p>
              <p>
                The unique combination of vehicle, sensor, and camera inputs
                provides real-time alerts for safety and operational events that
                help you better manage and protect your business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Active cooling allows it to operate in high- and low-temperature
                environments, and intelligent power management protects your
                vehicleâ€™s battery. Anti-tamper features, including security
                panels and battery backup, ensure that cameras remain online and
                available.
