    GPS tracking has been a part of our lives for over two decades. The
    technology is a part of all of our day to day work and leisure activities –
    your smartphone, camera, and really anything that shows where something is,
    anywhere on this planet. It probably seems unimaginable to get things done
    without it – case in point a world without driving directions in Google Maps
    or Waze? So when we talk about GPS Tracking as a service, what exactly does
    that mean? You can already track yourself and your loved ones with your
    phones, why do need it for your business?
  </p>
  <p>
    Put simply, GPS tracking as a standalone service does just one thing
    extremely well, locates your vehicle, container or trailer. So, whilst you
    can certainly track yourself with your mobile phone what you won’t be able
    to do is get the whole picture. Cars and trucks today have extremely
    sophisticated computers built in as a standard. These computers monitor and
    control everything to do with that vehicle's operation. Vital information
    such as unexpected equipment malfunctions, vehicle service reminders, the
    vehicle identification number and all the data from all the gauges used by
    the vehicle is being constantly updated, logged and modified by these
    onboard systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    As soon as you marry up GPS tracking with the wealth of data you can get
    from your vehicle, whether with an electronic logging device or other
    hardware, and get into that data stream, you instantly become able to know
    and manage your vehicles usage in ways that will surprise you. Let’s look at
    what you can do.
  </p>

  <h2>What Are Some GPS Tracking Benefits?</h2>

    alt="Satalite view gps tracking features"

    width="1280"
  />

  <p>
    The global positioning system or GPS enables real-time tracking. As soon as
    you have GPS tracking up and running you have the capability in place to
    know how fast a vehicle is traveling along with its location and that means
    you can spot and handle potentially bad driving habits, such as speeding,
    excessive acceleration or braking. You can see, right away, if an employee
    is using the vehicle for unauthorized use. You can set up alerts via text
    and email that tell you every time a vehicle leaves or arrives at a
    predetermined location, a function known as geofencing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This can all be done remotely, from your computer, tablet or phone. Of
    course, the driver gets some or all of the same data in real-time, and
    that’s going to affect their driving habits, for the better. Better drivers,
    with the data to back it up means better insurance rates, so you stand to
    save money on insurance.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what about vehicle maintenance? Anything your vehicle can tell you, via
    its onboard systems or with additional hardware can be monitored. That means
    critical component failure, all the data you’d normally see on the vehicles
    dash, vehicle service reminders, all of it is now yours to manage, wherever
    you are. Coupled with GPS tracking this information makes complete fleet
    tracking and management so much easier. Depending on the integration, you
    can even track parts, vendors and servicing data, easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fuel economy? This is easily tracked over time of vehicle use and changes in
    that economy show up changes in driving habits, mechanical faults, or both.
    You can also track how atmospheric conditions, bad weather or difficult
    terrain affect fuel use. For professional drivers, tracking fuel use and
    costs is a legal requirement for fuel taxes. Having full compliance is
    greatly simplified by the solutions available today.
  </p>

  <h2>Delivery Fleet Tracking</h2>

    height="720"
    width="1280"
  />

  <p>
    Deliveries? Again with GPS tracking you have the ability to use software
    that will automatically determine and present the most efficient delivery
    route to you and your drivers. And because tracking is happening in
    real-time you can always check and see if your driver, or team of drivers,
    is on or behind schedule and find out what’s going on and help reroute for
    example.
  </p>
  <p>
    These are just some of the ways GPS tracking can work to help you and your
    business operate with greater efficiency, cut costs and boost profits. You
    probably see that today, more than ever, this is a necessity in today’s
    business world.
