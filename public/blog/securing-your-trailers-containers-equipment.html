    One Step GPS thoroughly researches and only carries proven GPS tracking
    devices. Our prime interest is helping you find the best solution and we
    know different customers have different needs. Our focus is built on
    customer service, bringing you what you need at a great price, with no
    equipment costs and a very generous money back guarantee.
  </p>

  <h2>Equipment Tracking Devices</h2>

  <p>
    Many of our customers wanted a reliable and rugged solution for tracking
    their containers and trailers. All GPS trackers need a power source to
    operate, so how do you track an asset that may be stationary for long
    periods of time, in all climates? Solar GPS can cover that scenario. These
    devices are self-contained and self-powered.
  </p>
  <p>
    A high efficiency solar cell charges durable batteries and keeps the unit
    operational without external power. We did our homework and offer a great
    solar GPS unit. This unit updates every ten minutes when driving and every
    four hours when stationary. It is weatherproof and easily to install. It’ll
    run in extreme climates for months on end. Mounting is recommended for any
    place not easily accessible on the trailer or container. You can easily
    monitor location, unauthorized transit and set up geofences to alert you to
    unanticipated motion. When your trailers and containers are being moved by
    another driver this device can give you additional security, as well as
    peace of mind.
  </p>

  <h2>Asset Tracking With GPS Monitoring Systems</h2>

  <p>
    Say you have tracking on every asset in your fleet. You have the insight,
    because you have a real-time picture of where it’s all at on your computer,
    tablet or phone. You can pinpoint each asset and be sure they are where
    they’re supposed to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    We really are talking next level security. You know the location of your
    trailer in present time. It’s crucial if your trailer or container is being
    left at a remote site or is carrying valuable cargo. It is a no-brainer for
    routine tracking. There is no need to replace batteries, nothing to adjust
    or maintain, the unit is completely self-contained, alleviating any external
    power source. We only carry units that are top quality and reliable – our
    units operate in maritime and desert environments, they’re built to last in
    the most rigorous situations.
  </p>
  <p>
    What about a scenario where solar might not be ideal, like indoor storage or
    locations with poor or no light? We can cover that too, with units that are
    equipped with long life batteries for six month or three year use. These are
    equally good for construction equipment, freight items, as well as trailers
    and containers. Each unit offers different functionality including custom
    reporting intervals, engine hour monitoring, two PTOs (power take-off) and
    starter disable or remote shut off. That’s right, you can disable your
    equipment from anywhere you choose meaning you have full control over access
    and usage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Talking about equipment we even have a low power hardwired solution for
    assets and equipment that are frequently connected to power. It too offers
    customizable reporting intervals and alerts. Additional functionality also
    includes engine hour monitoring, PTO monitoring and starter disable or
    remote shut off.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok, so you have a lot of choices, and it really comes down to usage. What are
    your priorities for your equipment, freight, trailers and containers? Each
    solution offered will give you location on demand but from there the
    additional functionality is nothing short of amazing. Want to have
    maintenance alerts for your diggers? Want to know how many actual hours
    those generators have run? Want to ensure none of the site equipment runs
    after hours? Want to know exactly where that container is in the port –
    including elevation from the ground? You get the idea, so now what do you
    need to run your business better? We suggest you write out what you expect
    to achieve and then consult us on what’s going to do that for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    One Step GPS is different, and we want you to find out why. Our secret is no
    secret at all. We care about our customers, and we get them what they need.
    We don’t sell stuff we don’t believe in, and we won’t sell you something you
    don’t need. We’ve been doing what we do long enough to have gotten a great
    reputation for just that – being a friendly, reliable and caring company.
  </p>

  <h2>Asset Tracker Price</h2>

  <p>
    Sure, we have great prices, no contracts and crazy guarantees. Again, why?
    Because we want to help you, your friends and business associates and we
    want to do that for many years to come.
