    We’re going to show you how GPS Tracking is a vital component in becoming fully
    compliant to federal transportation mandates. Commercial drivers, long
    distance drivers, anyone who drives for a living needs to know and
    understand how GPS tracking and electronic device logging work and how
    simple it actually can be to be in compliance.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, let’s take all the mystery out of this subject by clearing it all up.
  </p>
  <p>
    These mandates come from
    <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/" target="_blank"
      >The Department of Transportation</a
    >
    (DOT). This is the North American government agency devoted to
    transportation. The U.S. DOT oversees interstate travel and is a federal
    agency. Within the DOT is
    <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/" target="_blank"
      >The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration</a
    >
    (FMCSA) that regulates the trucking industry in the United States. The
    primary mission of the FMCSA is to reduce crashes, injuries and fatalities
    involving large trucks and buses.

  <h2>Commercial Truck Tracking Devices</h2>

  <p>
    An electronic logging device, or ELD, is a device, typically a tablet,
    carried in the cab of a truck. Interfacing with the truck it records data
    including the operation of the vehicle, driver activity, hours of service
    and record of duty for each 24-hour period. Hours of service (HOS) is a term
    referring to the number of hours that a commercial motor vehicle driver is
    allowed work per day, or week, or other period as mandated by the Federal
    Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The Record of Duty (ROD) is a log
    containing the drivers name, date, and status throughout a 24-hour period.
    In addition a Driver Vehicle Inspection Report (DVIR) needs to be completed
    daily by drivers for any commercial vehicle they operate, as specified by
    Federal Law and enforced by the DOT. An ELD is used with a GPS tracker.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ELD gets used for the reporting of mileage and calculation of fuel
    economy for fuel tax calculation. This is mandated through the International
    Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) is an arrangement among U.S. states and Canada. It
    works as a "pay now or pay later" system. As commercial motor vehicles buy
    fuel, any fuel taxes paid are credited to that licensee's account. At the
    end of the fiscal quarter, the licensee completes their fuel tax report
    listing all miles traveled, in all participating jurisdictions, and lists
    all gallons purchased. Then the average MPG is applied to the miles traveled
    to determine the tax liability to each jurisdiction. Again, it needs the GPS
    tracker to do this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ok, so much for all the jargon, so you have an ELD to be able to track and
    log everything that the Federal Government requires by law and to ensure
    that drivers do not put themselves at risk due to fatigue etc., ELD
    compliance is a legal point that every driver and fleet must have in. You
    have to combine the ELD with a GPS tracker and software to report, log and
    monitor all this data.
  </p>
  <p>
    But having all this lets you do much more than just legal compliance. You
    can easily monitor the operational condition of your vehicles, in the
    vehicle and remotely. You can set up vehicle service reminders for routine
    maintenance. Mechanical faults can produce text and email alerts. Mileage
    and fuel economy are easily logged and can be viewed remotely along with
    location. Bad driving habits including speeding, erratic driving and misuse
    of a vehicles acceleration and braking can be tied to instant alerts. And
    because all this data is logged and clearly reported is enough to encourage
    many drivers to observe safer driving habits. And that will save you money.
    The very same data can be easily logged and shared to get better insurance
    rates.
