  <p>
    Nowadays, you can do almost anything with GPS tracking. Risk reduction is a
    great one, and our customers can use GPS tracking to help law enforcement
    during or after a safety event! We've had many customers use our GPS
    tracking to guide law enforcement directly to the location of the stolen
    vehicles, resulting in not only their vehicle, but also many other vehicles
    being recovered, and the perpetrators going to jail. The main thing people
    use GPS tracking for, is to know at any time, where exactly a vehicle is,
    and to know when it moves.
  </p>

  <h2>GPS Tracker Installation</h2>

  <p>
    We offer a simple plug-in unit, an OBD port tracking device that just plugs
    in under your dash, a simple three wire installation which can be hidden
    away, and a solar-powered tracker, which doesn't require any plugging in or
    wiring! Depending on your needs, one of our GPS tracking consultants would
    be happy to help you find the right mix of trackers for your specific
    circumstances.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’d also like to help with integration. That’s the software you use on
    computer, phone or tablet, that gets data from the tracker and presents it
    in a useful, informative way. The most basic thing is providing real-time
    tracking, you can see on a map where your vehicle is. But we can show you
    how you can do a whole lot more. You can see how fast it is going, when it
    accelerates or brakes dangerously or when it’s just idling someplace. You
    can get an alert when a vehicle makes an unexpected departure, like when
    your drivers are all home. You can set up alerts to any of this on a phone,
    computer, whatever you like.
  </p>

  <p>
    We want you to know about everything you can do with your tracking device.
    Like you’ve heard of Lojack, a device and service designed to track a
    vehicle in cases of theft or unauthorized use. It’s successful because it
    shares data with law enforcement. It’s a good product, but is by no means
    the only solution available today. We can show you other solutions that may
    actually be a lot less expensive.
  </p>

  <h2>Fleet Tracking Software</h2>

  <p>
    When we talk about risk reduction for your fleet there are really two pretty
    huge benefits. You can monitor in real-time the actual location of a vehicle
    that may be having a safety event. Being able to immediately share this data
    with law-enforcement is a big deal because the chances of being able to
    bring that crime incident to a good outcome are greatly increased. When the
    police can deal with it real-time they can do a lot more to help. In the
    second scenario GPS tracking data is exceedingly helpful to assisting any
    law-enforcement investigation, as it presents verifiable facts sometimes
    crucial to prosecution and conviction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Insurance companies are going to like you for having GPS. Having that data
    to hand after an accident, theft, robbery or carjacking incident helps
    establish fault and could mean the difference between an expensive rate hike
    and just regular old coverage costs. Even if the bad guys managed to find
    and disable the tracker, you did right by insurance for having a tracker at
    all.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, when you invest in GPS tracking you stand to keep your insurance costs
    low, you can quickly interface with law enforcement as the need arises, and
    you gain peace of mind for the safety and security of your fleet. With
    real-time tracking at your fingertips you can get alerts when things aren’t
    right with a vehicle.
  </p>
