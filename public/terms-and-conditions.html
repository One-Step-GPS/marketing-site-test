                      signed by both parties.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Waiver</strong>. No waiver of any right under this

                      writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the

                      affiliated entity or to a party acquiring all or
                      substantially all of its assets or equity. Notwithstanding

                      substantially all of its assets to, or undergoes a change
                      of control in favor of, a direct competitor of the other
                      party, then the other party may terminate this Agreement
                      upon written notice. This Agreement will bind and inure to
                      the benefit of the parties and their successors and

                      or other action of the elements, accidents, governmental
                      restrictions, appropriation or other causes beyond the

                      make payments hereunder and excluding any obligations

                      will be relieved of those obligations to the extent its
                      performance is prevented. Neither party will be liable for
                      any losses, injury, delay or damages suffered or incurred
