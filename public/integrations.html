Like you, it didn't take long for him to realize that putting out the daily fires could consume all his time. So, he pioneered an approach that got him out of the weeds of the day-to-day and into proactive solutions, keeping more of his vehicles safely on the road, more of the time.<br /><br /> After saving UPS more than $100 million during his time there (today, this would be more like $300 million, with inflation), Ron took all that he learned and created a fleet management software that actually meets managers'' real needs. Forty years later, Ron's business is still in the family, and our goal is the same: We help fleet managers run their fleets with more efficiency and less hassle at a cost their companies can't afford to pass up.<br /><br /> With a One Step GPS and RTA Fleet integration you can get DTC codes and odometer readings in RTA Fleets system",
