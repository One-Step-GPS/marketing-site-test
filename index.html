                    "text": "A GPS tracking device is installed in a vehicle (or piece of equipment or asset) to gather information, including speed, driving behavior, engine status, idle time, diagnostics, and more. It utilizes GPS satellites to determine where the tracked equipment is at all times. The gathered information is stored and transmitted by the device using cellular networks, using providers like AT&T and Verizon to send the data back to servers in the 'cloud.' All data stored on secure servers is processed and delivered to authorized users, fleet managers, office personnel, etc. Because the data is in the 'cloud,' you can access the information no matter where you are on a computer, tablet, or smartphone. The gathered data is then displayed on a map in near real-time. One Step GPS then offers a host of ways that the data can be processed and output, such as breadcrumb trails of where the vehicle has traveled, how fast it traveled on the way to a location, and how long it was stopped if it idled, and more. All the complexity of gathering the data is done in the background, so you only need to worry about setting up automated reports and alerts of the important and relevant information."

It installs in the diagnostics port of the car, truck, van, with variants for both light-duty and semi-trucks. They can easily be hidden and notifications sent for tampering if that ever happens. Other options include a wired device that requires electrical connections to be made and hidden within three feet of the connection. These fit many applications from vehicles, ATVs, boats, equipment, trailers and more. Most of our units, including the plugin and wired ones, get power from the vehicle even when off. You'll never need to charge them, and once installed, you never have to touch them again for years. Our support can answer more questions about these units and more specialized ones for equipment and trailers."

The most common areas of improvement include: Reduced fuel expenses resulting from many different reasons. Fewer accidents / Lower insurance rates & increased discounts. Improved employee productivity. Cut down on regular and overtime wages for the same amount or more work. Improved maintenance costs with fewer miles, wear and tear and maintenance expenditure. Faster and more efficient dispatching. Quicker time to respond to customers' calls. More jobs and happier clients."

They can drag one of your competitors down who isn't using GPS tracking, and you don't have to pay unemployment. All drivers are nervous at first, but good leadership overcomes this fear and builds a stronger, more profitable company.

                            With GPS fleet tracking, you no longer need to call drivers to find out where they are or

                            was actually there. Our web-based GPS tracking software allows you to easily follow your

                            turn by turn, gauge how long they have stopped at a particular location, and view past

                                A GPS tracking device is installed in a vehicle (or piece of equipment or asset) to
                                gather information, including speed, driving behavior, engine status, idle time,
                                diagnostics, and more. It utilizes GPS satellites to determine where the tracked
                                equipment is at all times. The gathered information is stored and transmitted by the
                                device using cellular networks, using providers like AT&T and Verizon to send the
                                data
                                back to servers in the "cloud."<br><br>
                                All data stored on secure servers is processed and delivered to authorized users,
                                fleet
                                managers, office personnel, etc. Because the data is in the "cloud," you can access
                                the
                                information no matter where you are on a computer, tablet, or smartphone <br><br>
                                The gathered data is then displayed on a map in near real-time. One Step GPS then
                                offers
                                a host of ways that the data can be processed and output, such as breadcrumb trails
                                of
                                where the vehicle has traveled, how fast it traveled on the way to a location, and
                                how
                                long it was stopped if it idled, and more. All the complexity of gathering the data
                                is
                                done in the background, so you only need to worry about setting up automated reports
                                and
                                alerts of the important and relevant information.

                                One of our best-selling trackers is the Plugin unit. It installs in the diagnostics
                                port of
                                the car, truck, van, with variants for both light-duty and semi-trucks. They can
                                easily be hidden and notifications sent for tampering if that ever happens. <br><br>
                                Other options include a wired device that requires electrical connections to be made
                                and hidden within three feet of the connection. These fit many applications from
                                vehicles, ATVs, boats, equipment, trailers and more. <br><br>
                                Most of our units, including the plugin and wired ones, get power from the vehicle
                                even when off. You'll never need to charge them, and once installed, you never
                                have to touch them again for years. <br><br>
                                Our support can answer more questions about these units and more specialized ones

                                and reports. You can also send the information to as many people/users as needed
                                to ensure your trackers will always be online.

                                It can vary by how the system is used, fleet policies and management. If the
                                company leaders are unwilling to use the data to make decisions, hold drivers
                                accountable, or improve operational flaws once spotted using this tool. <br><br>
                                ROI requires a commitment to improvements, policies to support the program and

                                GPS tracking can significantly impact workers' comp claims and other insurance
                                expenses with less speeding, fewer miles, much less personal miles, and more
                                attention given to driving. <br><br>
                                Bringing up "GPS tracking" in the hiring process can scare off potential employees
                                who may not work a full day once in the field. <br><br>
                                You can also hire better employees and retain the "best of the best" long-term. By
                                saving with GPS and not having unproductive employees, you can pay more for top-
                                notch employees while still paying less than you would before GPS, giving you the
                                edge up on your competition. <br><br>

                                It is more of an asset than just some business expense or "cost."

                    <div class=" paragraph-text">
                        A GPS tracking device is installed in a vehicle (or piece of equipment or asset) to
                        gather information, including speed, driving behavior, engine status, idle time,
                        diagnostics, and more. It utilizes GPS satellites to determine where the tracked
                        equipment is at all times. The gathered information is stored and transmitted by the
                        device using cellular networks, using providers like AT&T and Verizon to send the
                        data
                        back to servers in the "cloud."<br><br>
                        All data stored on secure servers is processed and delivered to authorized users,
                        fleet
                        managers, office personnel, etc. Because the data is in the "cloud," you can access
                        the
                        information no matter where you are on a computer, tablet, or smartphone <br><br>
                        The gathered data is then displayed on a map in near real-time. One Step GPS then
                        offers
                        a host of ways that the data can be processed and output, such as breadcrumb trails
                        of
                        where the vehicle has traveled, how fast it traveled on the way to a location, and
                        how
                        long it was stopped if it idled, and more. All the complexity of gathering the data
                        is
                        done in the background, so you only need to worry about setting up automated reports
                        and
                        alerts of the important and relevant information.

                        We have you covered, from fleet vehicles to trailers to yellow steel. We have GPS
                        devices for every application. <br><br>
                        One of our best-selling trackers is the Plugin unit. It installs in the diagnostics
                        port of
                        the car, truck, van, with variants for both light-duty and semi-trucks. They can
                        easily be hidden and notifications sent for tampering if that ever happens. <br><br>
                        Other options include a wired device that requires electrical connections to be made
                        and hidden within three feet of the connection. These fit many applications from
                        vehicles, ATVs, boats, equipment, trailers and more. <br><br>
                        Most of our units, including the plugin and wired ones, get power from the vehicle
                        even when off. You'll never need to charge them, and once installed, you never
                        have to touch them again for years. <br><br>
                        Our support can answer more questions about these units and more specialized ones for
                        equipment and trailers.

                        Yes. To put it simply, you will know as soon as someone removes the device. We

                        and reports. You can also send the information to as many people/users as needed
                        to ensure your trackers will always be online.

                        Some companies have salespeople double as trainers and some have dedicated

                    <div class=" paragraph-text">
                        It can vary by how the system is used, fleet policies and management. If the
                        company leaders are unwilling to use the data to make decisions, hold drivers
                        accountable, or improve operational flaws once spotted using this tool. <br><br>
                        ROI requires a commitment to improvements, policies to support the program and
                        the strength of management to enforce the policies. <br><br>
                        The most common areas of improvement include:
                        <ul class="m-0">
                            <li>
                                Reduced fuel expenses resulting from many different reasons.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Fewer accidents / Lower insurance rates & increased discounts.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Improved employee productivity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Improved employee productivity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cut down on regular and overtime wages for the same amount or more work.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Improved maintenance costs with fewer miles, wear and tear and
                                maintenance expenditure.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Faster and more efficient dispatching. Quicker time to respond to customers'
                                calls. More jobs and happier clients.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        GPS tracking can significantly impact workers' comp claims and other insurance
                        expenses with less speeding, fewer miles, much less personal miles, and more
                        attention given to driving. <br><br>
                        Bringing up "GPS tracking" in the hiring process can scare off potential employees
                        who may not work a full day once in the field. <br><br>
                        You can also hire better employees and retain the "best of the best" long-term. By
                        saving with GPS and not having unproductive employees, you can pay more for top-
                        notch employees while still paying less than you would before GPS, giving you the
                        edge up on your competition. <br><br>

                        It is more of an asset than just some business expense or "cost."

                    <div class=" paragraph-text">
                        Maybe. If you have a driver(s) quit, you just saved a ton of money. It seldom
                        happens, but anyone afraid to be tracked is hiding something. If they leave, great.
                        They can drag one of your competitors down who isn't using GPS tracking, and you
                        don't have to pay unemployment. All drivers are nervous at first, but good
                        leadership overcomes this fear and builds a stronger, more profitable company. It is
                        just another tool used by cutting-edge businesses that continue to improve and
                        grow.
